I used to have a nice, like, 'indie-esque' linktree thing here... but I broke it.

Now you get a terrible link list that is literally just the default GitHub markdown. Enjoy!

reading: https://standardebooks.org
actually reading: https://archiveofourown.org/
actually actually reading: the philosophy of science, the central issues
writing: nothing good, something terrible. I really should do research to make the dialogue believable...

public facing accounts: ...do I really not have any? 
well i have a facebook, youtube, linkedin, kikmessenger, livejournal, myspace, geocities (ok just the first three)

connect with me on discord, groupme, whatsapp, facebook messenger, text message, semaphore, smoke signals



the websites i made for clubs:
http://tribetrainclub.pages.wm.edu/
https://tribescribes.pages.wm.edu/

This is my personal site for now, I will eventually change the domain. I was inspired by the Hall of Mirrors in Versailles, of course.

Someone get me a template.
